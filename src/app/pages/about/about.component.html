    <p>My father says I do things that go on the internet.</p>
    <p>My name is Davide, a self-taught web developer and graphic designer, a video game expert, creator of imaginative
        passwords, cat lover, and a fan of learning new things.</p>
    <p>Despite the old computer of my parents being a testament to my great passion for design and all things digital
        from a
        young age—filled to the last byte with PowerPoint files packed with flags and logos reproduced using the
        geometric
        drawing tools available in the software—my post-high school career took a turn when I enrolled in the Civil
        Engineering program at the University of Genoa.</p>
    <p> However, a few exams short of earning my degree, I decided to put my university career on hold and return to my
        never-fading love for design: I then opened a VAT number and decided to become a freelance graphic designer.</p>
    <p>Over the years, this led me to collaborate with some digital agencies in the Genoa area and to contribute to the
        founding of the university-targeted startup Unigeneration (now Youni life).</p>
    <p>Following clients' requests and my curiosity in learning new things, over time my specialty shifted from
        illustration
        to web design, moving through brand design and 3D modeling.</p>
    <p>Intrigued by how an interface I designed could work, I realized that making mockups was no longer enough for me,
        so I
        delved into web development and learned the main programming languages and frameworks used in the field.</p>
    <p>Currently, I get paid to design colorful buttons and write magic formulas on a black screen to make interacting
        with
        those buttons as engaging as possible.</p>
    <p>As my father says: I do things that go on the internet.</p>
