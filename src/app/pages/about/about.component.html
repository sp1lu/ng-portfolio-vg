    <p>My father says I do things that go online.</p>
    <p>My name is Davide, an italian <b>self-taught web developer and graphic designer</b>, video game enthusiast,
        unique passwords creator, cat lover and lifelong learner.</p>
    <p>Despite the old computer of my parents being a testament to my great passion for design and all things digital
        from a young age—filled to the last byte with PowerPoint files packed with flags and logos reproduced using the
        geometric drawing tools available in the software—my post-high school career took a turn when I enrolled in the
        Civil Engineering course at the University of Genoa.</p>
    <p> However, a few exams short of earning my degree, I decided to put my university career on hold and return to my
        never-fading love for design: I then opened a VAT number and decided to become a <b>freelance graphic designer</b>.</p>
    <p>Over the years, this led me to collaborate with some digital agencies in the Genoa area and to contribute to the
        founding of the university-targeted startup <a href="https://youni.life/" target="_blank">Youni.life</a>.</p>
    <p>Following clients' requests and my curiosity in learning new things, over time my specialty shifted from
        <b>illustration</b> to <b>web design</b>, moving through <b>brand design</b> and <b>3D modeling</b>.
    </p>
    <p>Intrigued by how an interface I designed could work, I realized that making mockups was no longer enough for me,
        so I dived myself into web development and learned the main programming languages and frameworks used in the field.
    </p>
    <p>Currently, I get paid to design colorful buttons and write magic formulas on a black screen to make interacting
        with those buttons as engaging as possible.</p>
    <p>As my father says: <i>I do things that go online</i>.</p>
