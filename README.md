## ðŸ”° About
Personal portfolio as a link collector of my social accounts.

The aim of the project was to create a single page application that, despite the simplicity of being a simple link collector, was also creative and represented my passions.

Given my love for video games and their industry, the single page application mocks the main menu of a modern game.
